## About Me
Hello everyone, my name is Eddie and I am originally from Puerto Rico. I speak English,Spanish and a little Portuguese. I really do enjoy working as a programmer. My favorite programming language is C even though I consider myself to be a beginner when it comes to C programming. The little that I do know has helped me understand the underlying architecture of computers and how they work. C programming has also helped me get a better grasp on other programming languages like PHP and JavaScript.
